Given a .csv file with stock data from Yahoo Finance, this solution will display the stock data as candlesticks. The project uses MS Forms with .NET framework. The start and end date are pickable by the user and can be updated repeatedly to hone in on a specific time period of stock data. The user can specify a candlestick trend to highlight, at which point the form will indicate all the spots where that trend occurs. Multiple instances of the form can be opened by selecting multiple .csv files.
